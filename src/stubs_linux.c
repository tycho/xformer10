/* stubs_linux.c - Phase 1 external definitions for cross-TU inline functions.

   atari800.c, so they are invisible to xvideo.c and xsio.c that call them.
   This file provides external definitions WITHOUT including atari800.h so that
   the conflicting 'static inline' declaration from that header cannot override
   the external linkage of these definitions. */
